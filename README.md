<h1>She Loves Me... She Loves Me Not ðŸŒ¼ðŸ’”</h1>
<p>My attempt at an application that evaluates interest level based on texting behavior in dating (mainly for online dating) ðŸ˜‚ <br> <b>This is just for fun and does not provide a definitive answer, as we all know that human relationships are very nuanced and cannot always be quantified accurately.</b></p>
<h2>How This All Works - The Mathematical Model Behind It</h2>
<p>I first developed a VERY SIMPLISTIC mathematical model that estimates a girl's level of interest based on texting behavior. To do so, I tried my best to think of definitive signs that a girl has a strong interest in you... whatever "strong" means - maybe at least a crush? Not just things she may do that may indicate a stronger interest in you, like how most dating advice go. But actual signs that definitively prove ðŸ’¯ that a girl has interest in you. Please note that I thought of these signs in the context of meeting someone through online dating, as opposed to in-person, cold-approach dating (yes, that matters). Anyways, below are the model parameters that take into account the signs I have thought of.</p>
<h3>Thoughtfulness Score (TS)</h3>
<p>Measures the depth and personal nature of her responses.<br>
<b>Formula:</b> (Number of texts with personal details + Number of texts with personal questions) / Total number of texts<br>
<b>Range: </b>0 (least thoughtful) to 1 (most thoughtful)</p>
